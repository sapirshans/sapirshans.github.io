            Ever since I can remember myself, one of my greatest passions is to
            come up and implement <em>effective solutions</em>. I believe that
            good design begins at the root of the problem and grows from there
            to serve its purpose. This principle is applicable to different
            areas. From <em>UX design</em> to <em>programming</em> to{" "}
            <em>branding</em>, any solution must be simple and effective.
          </p>

            With experience in classical graphic visual design, user experience
            design, computer science, market strategy, and product design, I am
            able to look at a problem with multiple perspectives. My passion and
            curiousity fuel my hard-work ethic and creativity in these
            respective fields.
