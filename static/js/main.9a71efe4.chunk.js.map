There are still many overwhelming things on the discover\n            section, and in addition many playlists have either repetitive\n            artists or songs.\n          </p>\n          <h3>The People Problem</h3>\n          <p>\n            {\" \"}\n            After doing the five whys exercise, I came up with my initial people\n            problem.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <i>\n              When I look for new music, I want to be able to search for the\n              type of song I want to find, so I can save time looking.\n            </i>\n            <br />\n            <br /> But I can't do that well because:\n            <ul>\n              <li>There is a lot of music out there</li>\n              <li>\n                The current ways to search for music aren’t specific enough for\n                my needs\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </p>\n          <h2>Research</h2>\n          <p>\n            To look into this problem, I both conducted in user research in\n            person and online through a survey and an interview, as well as\n            market research.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Results</h3>\n          <p>\n            What I found in my research was that people had{\" \"}\n            <em>mixed feelings</em> about discovering new music, but slightly\n            more people tied <em>negative words</em> to it than positive ones.\n            Additionally, the way people most often find music is a natural one\n            with less effort rather than a search-heavy one (possibly due to the\n            search-heavy one being very time consuming as they described prior).\n            Most people discover new music through the people around them\n            (including friends) or through things they do in their daily life\n            like listening to the radio while driving, or going to a party or\n            event, or going to a store and listening to the background music.\n            Another thing that stood out in my interviews was that people either\n            looked for new music from artists they already like or looked for\n            new songs that fit the playlist <em>mood</em> or <em>a rhythm</em>{\" \"}\n            that they like. The last thing that I wanted to point out that I did\n            not show above was that a big point of frustration for people was\n            not finding exactly what they liked. A lot of times people would say\n            recommendations from Spotify were{\" \"}\n            <em>close but not close enough</em> to what they wanted, or that\n            they already knew about it, or that they didn’t trust them.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Market Research</h3>\n          <p>\n            Some current apps that address the issue of discovering new music\n            are Pandora, Shazam, and SoundCloud. <br />\n            Pandora, similar to Spotify, recommends music to users based off of\n            an algorithm that learns based off of likes and dislikes of a song\n            to recommend new ones. Different to Spotify, users get\n            recommendations only while listening to a radio. This takes away the\n            burden of looking for music off the user, but Spotify does that too\n            with their algorithm as well. <br />\n            Shazam allows people to find the song they are listening to\n            currently. Similar to Spotify, it also allows people to search for\n            top charts and new songs, however those features are widely less\n            known and used. It enhances how people find music naturally in the\n            world, by enabling them to keep track of songs that they like.{\" \"}\n            <br />\n            SoundCloud allows people to search for music through playlists,\n            similar to Spotify. Its more catered towards creators and people who\n            are looking for smaller artists, since they have the appeal of\n            anyone being able to post a song.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Redefining the People Problem</h3>\n          <p>\n            <i>\n              People want to find new music, but they have a hard time looking\n              for new songs or artists through the immense amount of existing\n              music.\n            </i>\n          </p>\n          <h2>Ideating</h2>\n          <p>\n            Now that I had all this information, it was time to get creative and\n            problem solve!\n          </p>\n          <h3>Trends</h3>\n          <img\n            src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-trends.png\"}\n            alt=\"trends\"\n          />\n          <h3>Journey Map</h3>\n          <img\n            src={\n              process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-journey-map.png\"\n            }\n            alt=\"journey map\"\n          />\n          <h3>Brainstorming</h3>\n          <p>\n            In order to come up with many diverse ideas, I brainstormed with my\n            friends Rebecca, a third year nutrition major, and Ariel, a second\n            year student undecided. They both have very different tastes in\n            music and both use Spotify to listen to music. After the HMW (How\n            May We)’s some of the restrictions in choosing Opportunity Areas\n            were lack of visual problems and more algorithm based problems\n            (specifically in the recommendations section). At the end of the\n            brainstorming session, we chose these 3 solution spaces because we\n            either thought they were very promising or interesting spaces. We\n            thought the description and identifying what you like about a song\n            spaces would be good to choose since we are dealing with a search\n            problem. The social aspect was to potentially mimic how people\n            ‘discover’ songs out in the real world.\n          </p>\n          <img\n            src={\n              process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-brainstorming.jpeg\"\n            }\n            alt=\"brainstorming\"\n          />\n          <h3>Evaluation</h3>\n          <p>\n            To evaluate all our ideas, I conducted a SWOT analysis as well as\n            weighed their feasibility vs. impact.\n          </p>\n          <img\n            src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-swot.png\"}\n            alt=\"SWOT analysis\"\n          />\n          <img\n            src={\n              process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-feasibility.png\"\n            }\n            alt=\"feasibility vs. impact\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            Finally, I decided that <em>song tags</em> would be the best way to\n            go. It’s a great answer to the people problem because it finally\n            allows users to search for songs NOT based on the artist or song\n            name, but\n            <em>based on content</em>. It allows users to be more specific in\n            what they want by searching multiple tags at a time, as well as let\n            people look for songs that might not necessarily be in a playlist,\n            especially since the Spotify playlists are repetitive. It’s better\n            than some of the other features because at least for the features we\n            came up with that aided people with what to search, it would not\n            restrict their search to Spotify, since Spotify doesn’t really have\n            a search mechanism at the moment that is content-based, as opposed\n            to title based.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Designing: Building the Feature</h2>\n          <p>\n            I chose the feature, but now I need to flesh it out and think of\n            what it will need and how it can be integrated into Spotify.\n          </p>\n          <h3>(Possible) Content Requirements: </h3>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Following a Tag: People might want song updates of a specific type\n              of song\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Using multiple tags: This would enable users to find something\n              really specific\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Everything should be able to be tagged — whether that be song,\n              artist, or playlist — because right now users can only search from\n              the name of the content.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Tag recommendations: Users might not know what tags to look up\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Tags should be clickable, if you click on a tag you are lead to\n              the ‘tag’ page\n            </li>\n            <li>Tag page</li>\n            <li>\n              Being able to play songs of a certain tag from your liked music\n              (or playlists?)\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <h3>Information Hierarchy</h3>\n          <img\n            src={\n              process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-info-hierarchy.png\"\n            }\n            alt=\"information hierarchy\"\n          />\n          <h3>Necessary Interactions</h3>\n          <img\n            src={\n              process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-interactions.png\"\n            }\n            alt=\"interactions\"\n          />\n          <h3>Medium Fidelity</h3>\n          <p>\n            I explored a couple options for where the tags would go and how a\n            user can get to them.\n          </p>\n          <img\n            src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-medfid1.png\"}\n            alt=\"mypic\"\n          />\n          <img\n            src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-medfid2.png\"}\n            alt=\"mypic\"\n          />\n          <img\n            src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-medfid3.png\"}\n            alt=\"mypic\"\n          />\n          <h2>Testing and Refining</h2>\n          <p>\n            The flows I chose to prototype were the listening entry point, as\n            well as the placeholder text underneath the search bar in the middle\n            search mechanism point. I wanted to test out a few key things: if\n            the user would be able to understand that the tags in the listening\n            page are links, how clear it was that there would be tags on that\n            page, and which placeholder text and description was better at\n            telling the user that they can search for multiple tags as well as\n            searching for songs and artists. So I came up with the following two\n            tasks for my tested users to do:\n            <ol>\n              <li>I want to look for electronic traditional music in Arabic</li>\n              <li>\n                I want to find songs similar to the one I am currently listening\n                to\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n            In all three of my tests, none of the users searched for multiple\n            tags — one searched for one or the other, and the other two searched\n            for the query in one tag linking the words together. I found that\n            the placeholder text helped people understand that tags required a\n            hashtag symbol in front of the search query, but did not help them\n            realize that they could search for multiple tags. It was not clear\n            that there would be tags on the listening page before seeing it, but\n            after seeing it, all of the users I tested figured out that you\n            could click on the tags (probably because you could click on the\n            artist already).\n          </p>\n          <h3>Iterations</h3>\n          <img\n            src={\n              process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-iterations1.png\"\n            }\n            alt=\"mypic\"\n          />\n          <img\n            src={\n              process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-iterations2.png\"\n            }\n            alt=\"mypic\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            The entry points remained the same because they felt natural to the\n            users, however I added a description for what the user could search\n            for to make the search mechanism more clear. To additionally make it\n            clear that the user could search for more than one tag, in the\n            listening entry point, I added the option to search for all of the\n            tags relevant to the song.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I also added tag adding to the end points to make it easier for the\n            user to add tags to their search and refine what they are looking\n            for. In the case of a search from the listening entry, it would be\n            other tags relevant to the song, but from the search bar it could\n            potentially be machine learning based on either what other users who\n            searched for this tag searched with it, or what tags the user tends\n            to listen to.\n          </p>\n          <img\n            src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"post-content/spotify-finalflow.png\"}\n            alt=\"mypic\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            The listening entry point was clear enough from the studies I\n            conducted, so I didn’t feel the need to change it.

The search\n            entry point, I added a description because that was unclear from the\n            research I conducted. In addition, to the last page I added a refine\n            your search section to make it easier for users to refine and get to\n            what they are searching for. I got rid of the two-page sorting, this\n            way the user gets to the results they want faster and in addition,\n            it is more natural to have the type selection on the top rather than\n            on the bottom.\n          </p>\n          <h3>More Iterations</h3>\n          <p>\n            Some problems that my current flow has are that it is not clear tags\n            can be pressed, and additionally, someone pointed out I should play\n            around with the search results because they don’t need to\n            necessarily be in list view.

Another is the\n            sorting tab with songs, artists, playlists, and albums as that’s how\n            the new search structure will sort search queries so there needed to\n            have a way to show what tab the user is on (how it looks like active\n            vs inactive).\n          </p>\n          <h2>Putting it All Together</h2>\n          <ReactPlayer url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAdp4pb8lgY\" />\n          <h2>Room for Improvement</h2>\n          <p>\n            The goal of this project was to experience the entire design process\n            from start to finish.

Finally, I didn't explore the artist-side user experience with\n            tags, which answers the question of who tags content.

Today, people take hundreds of pictures from a specific\n            event, and there’s no way to share them all (or most of them)\n            without either overwhelming your feed or having to access them one\n            by one by posting multiple pictures in one post.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Searching for Problems</h2>\n          <p>\n            I originally wanted to explore the travel niche on Instagram, but\n            after conducting some interviews with my friends and family,\n            although I didn’t get much information about the travel niche, I got\n            some information about personal Instagrams.\n            <ol>\n              <li>\n                <i>\n                  When I experience an event, I want to share my experiences, so\n                  I post on Instagram.\n                </i>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i>\n                  When I experience an event, I want to remember my experiences,\n                  so I post on Instagram.\n                </i>\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n            So the two main reasons for people who use Instagram for personal\n            reasons is to <em>share</em> and to <em>remember</em>.\n            <br />\n            Instagram is a social media platform, and as such it enables us to\n            share things that are going on in our lives. It specifically does it\n            through images, allowing us to share snapshots of events happening\n            in our lives.\n            <br />\n            It’s true that remembering is really not the point of Instagram, but\n            it brings up an interesting point — what if I want only want certain\n            people to remember certain things? Meaning, I want to share my\n            travels with my mom who follows me (hi mom!), but not my drunken\n            college parties (sorry mom…). And this is why Instagram introduced\n            the close friends feature for stories, but could something similar\n            be done to feeds? Additionally, often people post a few highlights\n            of trips or events on their feeds (many times wanting not to\n            overwhelm their followers with posts), but what do I do if I want to\n            remember it all? Not just the highlights. What do I do if:\n            <br />\n            <i>\n              I don’t just want to remember one picture (one event or moment)\n              from every couple of days, rather I want to remember all of the\n              amazing 10 or 20 or even more pictures (or events or moments) I\n              have from that day?\n            </i>\n            <br />\n            And honestly, the same goes with sharing. What if you want to share\n            your whole memory with people who are interested? Or if you want to\n            categorize your posts, grouping together your posts from each year\n            of college?\n            <br />\n            To my surprise, I ran into a couple of people telling me that they\n            make private accounts and don’t let anyone follow them, just for\n            that reason! To put all their pictures in them from a certain event,\n            kind of like modern-day albums, so that they can go back and look at\n            them. So in addition to their main account, they would have\n            additional ones that are called something like: yaelsgraduation15,\n            meandbaeinrome18, and so on and so forth.\n            <br />\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      category: \"User Experience Design\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"LingUp\",\n      description: \"How do we get more people to learn a new language?\",\n      date: \"\",\n      rendering: <ComingSoon></ComingSoon>,\n      category: \"User Experience Design\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"HopIt\",\n      description: \"\",\n      rendering: <ComingSoon></ComingSoon>,\n      category: \"Visual Design\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Artist&Title\",\n      description: \"\",\n      rendering: <ComingSoon></ComingSoon>,\n      category: \"Visual Design\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Addictiveness Project\",\n      description: \"\",\n      rendering: <ComingSoon></ComingSoon>,\n      category: \"User Experience Design\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Office Hours App\",\n      description: \"\",\n      rendering: <ComingSoon></ComingSoon>,\n      category: \"User Experience Design\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Play Among the Michelin Stars\",\n      description:\n        \"Data visualization exploring Michelin star restaurants across the globe.\",\n      rendering: <ComingSoon></ComingSoon>,\n      category: \"Data Visualization\",\n    },\n  ];\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  handleClick(proj) {\n    this.props.clickHandler(proj);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const project_titles_render = [];\n    const project_categories_render = [];\n\n    for (let proj of this.projects) {\n      var class_name =\n        \"project-title \" + \"title-\" + proj.category.split(\" \").join(\"\");\n      project_titles_render.push(\n        <a\n          className={class_name}\n          onClick={() => this.handleClick(proj)}\n          project={proj}\n          comingSoonHandler={this.props.comingSoonHandler}\n        >\n          {proj.title}\n        </a>\n      );\n      var class_name = \"project-category \" + proj.category.split(\" \").join(\"\");\n      project_categories_render.push(\n        <a className={class_name}>{proj.category}</a>\n      );\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <div id=\"projects-container\">\n        <div className=\"projects-titles\">{project_titles_render}</div>\n        <div className=\"projects-categories\">{project_categories_render}</div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\n//APP\nexport default class Post extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  \n  render() {\n    return (\n    <div className=\"overview-container\">\n      <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>\n      <p>{this.props.description} <br />\n      <em>dates: </em>{this.props.date} <br/>\n      <em>category: </em>{this.props.category}</p>\n    </div>\n  )};\n}","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Overview from './overview';\n\n//APP\nexport default class Post extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n    <div className=\"post-container\">\n      <Overview title={this.props.title} \n                description={this.props.description} \n                date={this.props.date}\n                category={this.props.category}>         \n      </Overview>\n      <hr />\n      {this.props.rendering}\n    </div>\n  )};\n}","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n\nexport default class About extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div id=\"about\">\n        <div id=\"about-text\">\n          <img\n            src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"about-profile.jpeg\"}\n            alt=\"this was supposed to be a picture of me, but enjoy this joke instead: \"\n            id=\"about-photo\"\n          />\n          <span id=\"hello\">Hi!</span> I'm Sapir and I'm a world-class{\" \"}\n          <em>problem-solver</em>. <br />\n          <br />\n          <p class=\"about-text\">\n            Ever since I can remember myself one of my greatest passions is to\n            come up and implement <em>effective solutions</em>.
